The library fails to consistently enforce configured request body size limits when processing HTTP requests utilizing Transfer-Encoding: chunked or those without a Content-Length header. This oversight allows a remote attacker to exploit affected servers by sending incomplete chunked requests, specifically by omitting the final zero-length chunk. This malicious activity causes the cpp-httplib server to continuously allocate memory as it waits for the non-existent termination. The resulting uncontrolled memory consumption can lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing server crashes or unresponsiveness, impacting system availability. The vulnerability is addressed in later versions of the cpp-httplib library through improved request parsing that enforces size limits and terminates connections exceeding those limits.",
