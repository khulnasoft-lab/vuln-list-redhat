  "statement": "This vulnerability is rated as moderate because it allows a remote attacker to trigger a denial of service through an out-of-bounds write, exploiting this flaw could crash the application, impacting availability but not compromising system security or integrity.\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive settings necessary for operational requirements. Baseline configurations and system controls ensure secure software settings, while least functionality reduces the attack surface by disabling unauthorized services and ports. The environment employs IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions to detect and prevent malicious code exploiting out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities, using mechanisms such as file integrity monitoring and patch management. Robust input validation and error handling ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing instability, data exposure, or privilege escalation. Finally, the platform uses memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to strengthen resilience against out-of-bounds write exploits.",
