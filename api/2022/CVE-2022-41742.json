  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive settings necessary for operational requirements. Baseline configurations and system controls ensure secure software settings, while least functionality reduces the attack surface by disabling unauthorized services and ports. The environment employs IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions to detect and prevent malicious code exploiting out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities, using mechanisms such as file integrity monitoring and patch management. Robust input validation and error handling ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing instability, data exposure, or privilege escalation. Finally, the platform uses memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to strengthen resilience against out-of-bounds write exploits.",

    "NGINX Open Source before versions 1.23.2 and 1.22.1, NGINX Open Source Subscription before versions R2 P1 and R1 P1, and NGINX Plus before versions R27 P1 and R26 P1 have a vulnerability in the module ngx_http_mp4_module that might allow a local attacker to cause a worker process crash, or might result in worker process memory disclosure by using a specially crafted audio or video file. The issue affects only NGINX products that are built with the module ngx_http_mp4_module, when the mp4 directive is used in the configuration file. Further, the attack is possible only if an attacker can trigger processing of a specially crafted audio or video file with the module ngx_http_mp4_module.",
