    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nhugetlbfs: don't delete error page from pagecache\nThis change is very similar to the change that was made for shmem [1], and\nit solves the same problem but for HugeTLBFS instead.\nCurrently, when poison is found in a HugeTLB page, the page is removed\nfrom the page cache.  That means that attempting to map or read that\nhugepage in the future will result in a new hugepage being allocated\ninstead of notifying the user that the page was poisoned.  As [1] states,\nthis is effectively memory corruption.\nThe fix is to leave the page in the page cache.  If the user attempts to\nuse a poisoned HugeTLB page with a syscall, the syscall will fail with\nEIO, the same error code that shmem uses.  For attempts to map the page,\nthe thread will get a BUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS.\n[1]: commit a76054266661 (\"mm: shmem: don't truncate page if memory failure happens\")"
