  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ntracing: Fix potential double free in create_var_ref()\nIn create_var_ref(), init_var_ref() is called to initialize the fields\nof variable ref_field, which is allocated in the previous function call\nto create_hist_field(). Function init_var_ref() allocates the\ncorresponding fields such as ref_field-\u003esystem, but frees these fields\nwhen the function encounters an error. The caller later calls\ndestroy_hist_field() to conduct error handling, which frees the fields\nand the variable itself. This results in double free of the fields which\nare already freed in the previous function.\nFix this by storing NULL to the corresponding fields when they are freed\nin init_var_ref().",
    "A double-free vulnerability has been identified within the Linux kernel. This issue arises from a sequence of function calls involving create_hist_field(), init_var_ref(), and destroy_hist_field(). Specifically, init_var_ref() allocates memory for fields within a variable (ref_field-\u003esystem). However, if an error occurs within init_var_ref(), these newly allocated fields are prematurely freed. Subsequently, the calling function invokes destroy_hist_field() as part of its error handling routine. This function then attempts to free the same fields, along with the variable itself, resulting in a double-free condition. Successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption and potentially a denial-of-service."
