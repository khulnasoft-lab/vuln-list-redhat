  "statement": "This vulnerability is rated as a moderate, due to a missing bounds check  in generate_jsimd_ycc_rgb_convert_neon within jsimd_arm64_neon.S, which could cause an out-of-bounds write, this could result in remote code execution, it requires user interaction (such as opening a crafted file) for exploitation, achieving successful exploitation is difficult and depends on specific conditions.\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is coupled with least privilege principles to ensure that only authorized roles and users can execute or manipulate code. Red Hat enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. This minimizes the number of components that could be affected by stack-based buffer overflow exploitations. The environment leverages malicious code protections such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions that detect and respond to indicators in real time, preventing or limiting the impact of exploitation attempts. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques are used to ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) are used to enhance resilience against memory buffer overflows and denial-of-service attacks.",
