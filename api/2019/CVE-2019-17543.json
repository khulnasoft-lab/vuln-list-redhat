  "statement": "According to upstream, this flaw cannot be exploited under normal, documented use of the LZ4 library API. Additionally, the flaw is present only in the LZ4 library itself, and the application binaries shipped with this package are not affected. \nRed Hat OpenStack Platform 10 includes an older version of LZ4 that contains the flawed code. However, OpenStack has been using RHEL's updated LZ4 version since RHEL 7.5, so Red Hat is not issuing an update for the OpenStack LZ4 package. This CVE is rated as moderate because Red Hat products do not use the vulnerable version of lz4 in current OpenStack offerings.\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is coupled with least privilege principles to ensure that only authorized roles and users can execute or manipulate code. Red Hat enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. This minimizes the number of components that could be affected by heap-based buffer overflow exploitations. The environment leverages malicious code protections such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions that detect and respond to indicators in real time, preventing or limiting the impact of exploitation attempts. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) enhance resilience against memory buffer overflows and denial-of-service attacks.",

  "details": [
    "LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (related to LZ4_compress_destSize), affecting applications that call LZ4_compress_fast with a large input.
