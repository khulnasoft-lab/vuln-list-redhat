  "statement": "Red Hat has determined this flaw to be of moderate impact as the attack triggers an uncontrolled recursion beyond the attacker's control and results in a DoS, which can cause service disruptions but does not directly enable privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nInput validation controls ensure that inputs triggering recursion are validated to stay within safe limits, which reduces the risk of infinite or excessive recursion. The implementation of least functionality on the platform further restricts potential impacts of recursions by disabling unnecessary recursive functions or features, thus reducing the available pathways for a would-be attacker. The inclusion of developer testing and evaluation ensures that recursive functions are tested and that safeguards like error handling are in place. In the case of successful exploitation, detection and containment controls are in place to limit impacts by alerting on anomalous system behavior in real time, while process isolation can limit impacts to a single process.",

  "details": [
    "url::recvline in url.cpp in libproxy 0.4.x through 0.4.15 allows a remote HTTP server to trigger uncontrolled recursion via a response composed of an infinite stream that lacks a newline character. This leads to stack exhaustion.",
    "A flaw was found in libproxy in versions 0.4 through 0.4.15. A remote HTTP server can trigger an uncontrolled recursion via a response composed of an infinite stream that lacks a newline character leading to a stack exhaustion. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
