  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Net::IMAP, a Ruby library for IMAP client functionality. This vulnerability allows a malicious server to send a large \"literal\" byte count, causing the client to allocate excessive memory, potentially leading to denial of service (memory exhaustion). This vulnerability could allow an attacker to overload the system's memory, causing performance degradation or crashes when connecting to untrusted or compromised IMAP servers."
