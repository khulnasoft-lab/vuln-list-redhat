  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-287: Improper Authentication vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful authentication through multifactor authentication (MFA). Domain accounts are configured to lock out based on predefined access policies, reducing the effectiveness of brute-force attacks on authentication mechanisms. The platform employs IAM roles for identification and authentication within its cloud infrastructure that govern user access to resources and manage provisioning, deployment, and configuration within the platform environment. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access through third-party or external user accounts. Finally, memory protection mechanisms are used to enhance resilience against unauthorized commands or improper authentication.",

  "details": [
    "When multiple server blocks are configured to share the same IP address and port, an attacker can use session resumption to bypass client certificate authentication requirements on these servers. This vulnerability arises when  TLS Session Tickets https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_ticket_key  are used and/or the  SSL session cache https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_cache  are used in the default server and the default server is performing client certificate authentication.  \nNote: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.",
    "A flaw was found in nginx. When name-based virtual hosts are configured to share the same IP address and port combination with TLS 1.3 and OpenSSL, a previously authenticated attacker can use session resumption to bypass client certificate authentication requirements on these servers. This vulnerability arises when TLS session tickets are used, the SSL session cache is used in the default virtual server, and the default virtual server performs client certificate authentication."
