    "Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Â For a subset of unlikely rewrite rule configurations, it was possible \nfor a specially crafted request to bypass some rewrite rules. If those \nrewrite rules effectively enforced security constraints, those \nconstraints could be bypassed.\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.5, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.39, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.102.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version [FIXED_VERSION], which fixes the issue.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat's rewrite rule processing component. This vulnerability allows security constraints to be bypassed via specially crafted HTTP requests when specific, uncommon rewrite rule configurations are in use."
