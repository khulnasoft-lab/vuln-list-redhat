  "statement": "This vulnerability is classified as high due to its ability to completely bypass role-based access controls, allowing users with VIEWER or EDITOR roles to access, modify, or delete dashboards regardless of permissions. The impact is further amplified when anonymous authentication is enabled, where unauthenticated users can perform privileged actions, significantly increasing exposure. Although organization-level isolation remains intact, the failure to enforce dashboard-level permissions undermines core security guarantees. \nItâ€™s important to note that this issue affects only Grafana version 11.6.0, which is not included in any Red Hat supported builds, and therefore Red Hat customers are not impacted.",
