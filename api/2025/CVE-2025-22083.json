    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nvhost-scsi: Fix handling of multiple calls to vhost_scsi_set_endpoint\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times without a\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint between them, we can hit multiple bugs\nfound by Haoran Zhang:\n1. Use-after-free when no tpgs are found:\nThis fixes a use after free that occurs when vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is\ncalled more than once and calls after the first call do not find any\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg. When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:\nvhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg);\n...\nkfree(vs-\u003evs_tpg);\nvs-\u003evs_tpg = vs_tpg;\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found\nmatch=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the\npointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:\nkfree(vs-\u003evs_tpg);\nvs-\u003evs_tpg = vs_tpg;\nIf a scsi request is then sent we do:\nvhost_scsi_handle_vq -\u003e vhost_scsi_get_req -\u003e vhost_vq_get_backend\nwhich sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.\n2. Tpg dir removal hang:\nThis patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer\ntpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount\ndropping to -1.\nThe problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already\nin the vs-\u003evs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so\ntarget_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their\nrefcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added\nin the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in\nprevious calls which are also in vs-\u003evs_tpg.\nLater, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs-\u003evs_tpg which will drop\ntheir refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg\nand will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.\n3. Tpg leak:\nThis fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be\nun-removable because the target name is overwritten when\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different\ntarget names.\nThe bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup\na vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls\nVHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we\nhaven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this\nhappens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite\nthe target name and the vs-\u003evs_tpg array. Later when we do\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's\nname and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the\nvs-\u003evs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing\ntarget_undepend_item on the tpgs.\nBecause of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major\nuser, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the\nissues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called\nif it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the\ntpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint\nfirst."
