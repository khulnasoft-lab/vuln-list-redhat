    "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. Incorrect error handling for some invalid HTTP priority headers resulted in incomplete clean-up of the failed request which created a memory leak. A large number of such requests could trigger an OutOfMemoryException resulting in a denial of service.\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 9.0.76 through 9.0.102, from 10.1.10 through 10.1.39, from 11.0.0-M2 through 11.0.5.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.104, 10.1.40 or 11.0.6 which fix the issue.",
    "A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat. This vulnerability allows an application-level denial of service (DoS), causing it to become unresponsive or slow via maliciously crafted HTTP/2 prioritization headers. It performs an incomplete cleanup of failed requests, which triggers a memory leak."
