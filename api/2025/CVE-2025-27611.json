  "details": [
    "base-x is a base encoder and decoder of any given alphabet using bitcoin style leading zero compression. Versions 4.0.0, 5.0.0, and all prior to 3.0.11, are vulnerable to attackers potentially deceiving users into sending funds to an unintended address. This issue has been patched in versions 3.0.11, 4.0.1, and 5.0.1.",
    "A flaw was found in base-x. This vulnerability allows attackers to generate addresses that appear legitimate, tricking users into sending money to them instead of the intended ones. The problem arises from the way base-x compresses leading zeros in addresses via manipulation of the base encoding mechanism."
