  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive settings required for operations, while baseline configurations maintain secure system and software states. A defense-in-depth monitoring strategy includes perimeter firewalls and endpoint protection services that detect and respond to indicators in real time, enabling logging and auditing of system behavior to identify and address improper exception handling. Automated integrity checks alert on unverified exception-related errors, while memory protection mechanisms reduce the risk of crashes or vulnerabilities caused by improper handling.",

    "BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. A malicious BuildKit client or frontend could craft a request that could lead to BuildKit daemon crashing with a panic. The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5. As a workaround, avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Moby Builder Toolkit. A malicious BuildKit client or any frontend that can craft a request could lead to the BuildKit daemon crashing with a panic due to the lack of input validation. A frontend is usually specified as the #syntax line on a Dockerfile or with the --frontend flag when using the buildctl build command."
