  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nRed Hat enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. This minimizes the number of components that could be affected by input validation vulnerabilities. Security testing and evaluation standards are implemented within the environment to rigorously test input validation mechanisms during the development lifecycle, while static code analysis identifies potential input validation vulnerabilities by default. Process isolation ensures that processes handling potentially malicious or unvalidated inputs run in isolated environments by separating execution domains for each process. Malicious code protections, such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions, help detect and mitigate malicious payloads stemming from input validation vulnerabilities. Finally, robust input validation and error-handling mechanisms ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks further.",

  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmptcp: fix data re-injection from stale subflow\nWhen the MPTCP PM detects that a subflow is stale, all the packet\nscheduler must re-inject all the mptcp-level unacked data. To avoid\nacquiring unneeded locks, it first try to check if any unacked data\nis present at all in the RTX queue, but such check is currently\nbroken, as it uses TCP-specific helper on an MPTCP socket.\nFunnily enough fuzzers and static checkers are happy, as the accessed\nmemory still belongs to the mptcp_sock struct, and even from a\nfunctional perspective the recovery completed successfully, as\nthe short-cut test always failed.\nA recent unrelated TCP change - commit d5fed5addb2b (\"tcp: reorganize\ntcp_sock fast path variables\") - exposed the issue, as the tcp field\nreorganization makes the mptcp code always skip the re-inection.\nFix the issue dropping the bogus call: we are on a slow path, the early\noptimization proved once again to be evil.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A logical error in the Multipath TCP packet manager causes some packets intended for retransmission to be lost, resulting in a potential denial of service."
