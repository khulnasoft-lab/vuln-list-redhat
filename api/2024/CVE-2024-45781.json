  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive settings necessary for operational requirements. Baseline configurations and system controls ensure secure software settings, while least functionality reduces the attack surface by disabling unauthorized services and ports. The environment employs IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions to detect and prevent malicious code exploiting out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities, using mechanisms such as file integrity monitoring and patch management. Robust input validation and error handling ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing instability, data exposure, or privilege escalation. Finally, the platform uses memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to strengthen resilience against out-of-bounds write exploits.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in grub2. When reading a symbolic link's name from a UFS filesystem, grub2 fails to validate the string length taken as an input. The lack of validation may lead to a heap out-of-bounds write, causing data integrity issues and eventually allowing an attacker to circumvent secure boot protections.",
