  "details": [
    "pnpm is a package manager. Prior to version 10.0.0, the path shortening function uses the md5 function as a path shortening compression function, and if a collision occurs, it will result in the same storage path for two different libraries. Although the real names are under the package name /node_modoules/, there are no version numbers for the libraries they refer to. This issue has been patched in version 10.0.0.",
    "A flaw was found in the pnpm package manager. In the affected versions, the path shortening function utilizes the MD5 hashing algorithm for compressing paths. If a collision occurs, this can lead to two different libraries being stored in the same path. Although the real names of these libraries are stored under the package name in the /node_modules/ directory, the version numbers for the libraries are not included."
