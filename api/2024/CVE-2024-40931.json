  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability and downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nRed Hat restricts access to all platform information by default, granting access only after successful hard token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enforcing least privilege to ensure only authorized roles can execute or modify code. The environment employs malicious code protections, including IDS/IPS and antimalware tools to detect threats and monitor resource usage, helping prevent uncontrolled consumption that could lead to system failure. \nAdditional safeguards, such as web application firewalls and load-balancing strategies, protect against resource exhaustion and performance degradation. Event logs are centrally collected, correlated, and analyzed to support monitoring, alerting, and retention, aiding in the detection of abnormal behavior and potential denial-of-service (DoS) conditions. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling, reducing the likelihood of input-based denial of service (DoS) attacks.",

    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmptcp: ensure snd_una is properly initialized on connect\nThis is strictly related to commit fb7a0d334894 (\"mptcp: ensure snd_nxt\nis properly initialized on connect\"). It turns out that syzkaller can\ntrigger the retransmit after fallback and before processing any other\nincoming packet - so that snd_una is still left uninitialized.\nAddress the issue explicitly initializing snd_una together with snd_nxt\nand write_seq.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's match component in the initialization of the snd_una variable while establishing a connection. The issue arises when retransmission occurs after a fallback, leaving the snd_una sequence number uninitialized, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential denial of service."
