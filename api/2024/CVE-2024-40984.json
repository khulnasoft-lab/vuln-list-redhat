  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability and downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nThe platform incorporates secure engineering principles and controls to enforce secure coding practices, including proper memory handling and error checking, reducing the likelihood of NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities. Coding standards, tools, and processes support early detection and prevention of memory-related flaws. Static code analysis identifies NULL dereference and related issues during development, while system monitoring detects memory errors and anomalous behavior in the event of exploitation. \nAdditionally, the platform leverages memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to strengthen resilience against memory-related vulnerabilities.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nACPICA: Revert \"ACPICA: avoid Info: mapping multiple BARs. Your kernel is fine.\"\nUndo the modifications made in commit d410ee5109a1 (\"ACPICA: avoid\n\"Info: mapping multiple BARs. Your kernel is fine.\"\"). The initial\npurpose of this commit was to stop memory mappings for operation\nregions from overlapping page boundaries, as it can trigger warnings\nif different page attributes are present.\nHowever, it was found that when this situation arises, mapping\ncontinues until the boundary's end, but there is still an attempt to\nread/write the entire length of the map, leading to a NULL pointer\ndeference. For example, if a four-byte mapping request is made but\nonly one byte is mapped because it hits the current page boundary's\nend, a four-byte read/write attempt is still made, resulting in a NULL\npointer deference.\nInstead, map the entire length, as the ACPI specification does not\nmandate that it must be within the same page boundary. It is\npermissible for it to be mapped across different regions.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's ACPICA component, where improper handling of memory mappings can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. This issue arises when mapping requests exceed page boundaries, resulting in attempts to access unmapped memory."
