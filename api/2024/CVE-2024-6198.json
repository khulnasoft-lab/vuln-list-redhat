  "details": [
    "The device exposes a web interface on ports TCP/3030 and TCP/9882. This web service runs lighttpd, which implements the “SNORE” interface. This interface is affected by a stack buffer overflow vulnerability due to insecure path parsing. An attacker\nwith access to the LAN network interface could use a specially crafted HTTP request to exploit a buffer overflow on the modem."
