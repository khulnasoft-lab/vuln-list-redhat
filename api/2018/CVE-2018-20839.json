  "statement": "Red Hat Product Security has determined that exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to physically input keystrokes on the targeted system. The issue results in confidential information being exposed in cleartext, but it does not alter any recorded data, thereby not affecting the system's integrity. Additionally, there is no known method to disrupt the availability of the systemd daemon. Consequently, both the 'Integrity' and 'Availability' impacts are assessed as 'None.'",

  "details": [
    "systemd 242 changes the VT1 mode upon a logout, which allows attackers to read cleartext passwords in certain circumstances, such as watching a shutdown, or using Ctrl-Alt-F1 and Ctrl-Alt-F2. This occurs because the KDGKBMODE (aka current keyboard mode) check is mishandled."
