  "details": [
    "In Ubuntu, gnome-control-center did not properly reflect SSH remote login status when the system was configured to use systemd socket activation for openssh-server. This could unknowingly leave the local machine exposed to remote SSH access contrary to expectation of the user.",
    "A flaw was found in the GNOME Control Center. This vulnerability allows the SSH service to be improperly enabled without properly managing systemd units, which could unintentionally expose remote login access through insecure service activation management."
