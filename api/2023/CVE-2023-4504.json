  "statement": "This vulnerability is rated as moderate because a heap-based buffer overflow in CUPS and libppd, caused by improper length validation in attacker-crafted PPD PostScript documents, could lead to application crashes or potential code execution, successful exploitation depends on specific conditions, such as the application's processing of untrusted PPD files, limiting the overall impact in most cases.\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is coupled with least privilege principles to ensure that only authorized roles and users can execute or manipulate code. Red Hat enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. This minimizes the number of components that could be affected by heap-based buffer overflow exploitations. The environment leverages malicious code protections such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions that detect and respond to indicators in real time, preventing or limiting the impact of exploitation attempts. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) enhance resilience against memory buffer overflows and denial-of-service attacks.",

  "name": "CVE-2023-4504",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Due to failure in validating the length provided by an attacker-crafted PPD PostScript document, CUPS and libppd are susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow and possibly code execution. This issue has been fixed in CUPS version 2.4.7, released in September of 2023.",
    "A vulnerability was found in CUPS and libppd, where a failure to validate the length provided in an attacker-crafted PPD PostScript document can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow, causing a denial of service or, in some cases, execute arbitrary code, depending on how the application processes untrusted PPD files."
