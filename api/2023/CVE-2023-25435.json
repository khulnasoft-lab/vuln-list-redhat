  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nRed Hat follows best practice and federal requirements for least privilege, allowing only specific processes to be run with isolated accounts specific to the team and federal platforms that have limited privileges that are only used for a single task. The environment leverages file integrity checks and malicious code protections, such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions, to help detect and prevent malicious code that attempts to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Robust input validation and error-handling mechanisms ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks.",

    "A flaw was found in tiffcrop, a program distributed by the libtiff package. A specially crafted tiff file can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow in the extractContigSamplesShifted8bits function in tools/tiffcrop.c, resulting in a denial of service."
