  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nThe use of baseline configurations, change control, and configuration settings within the platform enforces secure system configurations, patch management, and proper runtime settings, which helps prevent the introduction of memory handling issues through insecure defaults, unpatched components, and misconfigurations. Specifically, the use of process isolation and memory protection ensures memory integrity by isolating processes and enforcing memory protection mechanisms that limit an attacker's ability to exploit or read memory. System monitoring controls provide an additional layer of protection in the detection of anomalous behavior and unauthorized memory-related access.",

  "details": [
    "LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds read in tiffcrop in tools/tiffcrop.c:3488, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit afaabc3e.",
    "A flaw was found in tiffcrop, a program distributed by the libtiff package. A specially crafted tiff file can lead to an out-of-bounds read in the extractContigSamplesShifted16bits function in tools/tiffcrop.c, resulting in a Denial of Service and limited information disclosure."
