    "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbpf: Adjust insufficient default bpf_jit_limit\nWe've seen recent AWS EKS (Kubernetes) user reports like the following:\nAfter upgrading EKS nodes from v20230203 to v20230217 on our 1.24 EKS\nclusters after a few days a number of the nodes have containers stuck\nin ContainerCreating state or liveness/readiness probes reporting the\nfollowing error:\nReadiness probe errored: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to\nexec in container: failed to start exec \"4a11039f730203ffc003b7[...]\":\nOCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process:\nunable to init seccomp: error loading seccomp filter into kernel:\nerror loading seccomp filter: errno 524: unknown\nHowever, we had not been seeing this issue on previous AMIs and it only\nstarted to occur on v20230217 (following the upgrade from kernel 5.4 to\n5.10) with no other changes to the underlying cluster or workloads.\nWe tried the suggestions from that issue (sysctl net.core.bpf_jit_limit=452534528)\nwhich helped to immediately allow containers to be created and probes to\nexecute but after approximately a day the issue returned and the value\nreturned by cat /proc/vmallocinfo | grep bpf_jit | awk '{s+=$2} END {print s}'\nwas steadily increasing.\nI tested bpf tree to observe bpf_jit_charge_modmem, bpf_jit_uncharge_modmem\ntheir sizes passed in as well as bpf_jit_current under tcpdump BPF filter,\nseccomp BPF and native (e)BPF programs, and the behavior all looks sane\nand expected, that is nothing \"leaking\" from an upstream perspective.\nThe bpf_jit_limit knob was originally added in order to avoid a situation\nwhere unprivileged applications loading BPF programs (e.g. seccomp BPF\npolicies) consuming all the module memory space via BPF JIT such that loading\nof kernel modules would be prevented. The default limit was defined back in\n2018 and while good enough back then, we are generally seeing far more BPF\nconsumers today.\nAdjust the limit for the BPF JIT pool from originally 1/4 to now 1/2 of the\nmodule memory space to better reflect today's needs and avoid more users\nrunning into potentially hard to debug issues."
