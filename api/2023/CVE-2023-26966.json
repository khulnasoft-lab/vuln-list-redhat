  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nRed Hat follows best practice and federal requirements for least privilege, allowing only specific processes to be run with isolated accounts specific to the team and federal platforms that have limited privileges that are only used for a single task. The environment leverages file integrity checks and malicious code protections, such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions, to help detect and prevent malicious code that attempts to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Robust input validation and error-handling mechanisms ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks.",

  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "libtiff 4.5.0 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow in uv_encode() when libtiff reads a corrupted little-endian TIFF file and specifies the output to be big-endian.",
    "A flaw was found in libtiff. A specially crafted tiff file can lead to a segmentation fault due to an out-of-bounds read in the uv_encode function in libtiff/tif_luv.c, resulting in a denial of service."
