  "cwe": "CWE-416",
  "statement": "Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-416: Use After Free vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) and is governed by least privilege to ensure that only authorized users and roles can execute or modify code. Red Hat also enforces least functionality, enabling only essential features, services, and ports. Hardening guidelines ensure the most restrictive settings required for operations, while baseline configurations enforce safe memory allocation and deallocation practices to reduce the risk of use-after-free vulnerabilities. The environment employs IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions to detect and prevent malicious code and provide real-time visibility into memory usage, lowering the risk of arbitrary code execution. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling, reducing the likelihood of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In the event of successful exploitation, process isolation prevents a compromised process from accessing memory freed by another, containing potential impact. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) enhance resilience against memory-related vulnerabilities.",

  "name": "CVE-2023-26965",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "loadImage() in tools/tiffcrop.c in LibTIFF through 4.5.0 has a heap-based use after free via a crafted TIFF image.",
    "A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in LibTIFF's tiffcrop utility in the loadImage() function. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF image file to the tiffcrop utility, which causes an out-of-bounds write access, resulting in an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service."
