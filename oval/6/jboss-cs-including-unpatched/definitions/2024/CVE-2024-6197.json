    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in cURL's utf8asn1str() function in the ASN1 parser, which causes a denial of service due to a memory allocation flaw. This flaw allows a remote attacker to use a specially crafted TLS certificate, causing the function to invoke free() on a 4-byte local stack buffer. While most modern malloc implementations detect and abort this error, some accept the pointer, leading to stack memory overwriting. This flaw likely results in a crash, though more serious consequences are possible in certain conditions. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
