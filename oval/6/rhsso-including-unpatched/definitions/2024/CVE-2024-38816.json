    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Spring applications using the WebMvc.fn or WebFlux.fn frameworks. This issue can allow attackers to perform path traversal attacks via crafted HTTP requests when the application serves static resources using RouterFunctions and explicitly configures resource handling with a FileSystemResource location. \n            STATEMENT: Path traversal vulnerabilities in applications that serve static resources via RouterFunctions and FileSystemResource pose a important security risk, as they allow attackers to bypass access controls and retrieve arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This type of attack can lead to unauthorized exposure of sensitive data, such as configuration files, environment variables, or authentication credentials. If exploited, it can further facilitate privilege escalation, lateral movement, or remote code execution within the system. Given the broad access it grants to the server's filesystem, the potential for system compromise makes path traversal vulnerabilities a high-severity issue.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
