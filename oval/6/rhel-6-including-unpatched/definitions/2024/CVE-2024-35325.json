    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in libyaml in versions up to 0.2.5. This issue affects the yaml_event_delete function in the /src/libyaml/src/api.c. file, leading to a double-free problem. \n            STATEMENT: To create the conditions for this vulnerability, yaml_event_delete must be called after yaml_emitter_delete, creating double free whenever there are anchors or tags involved. This ordering implies improper API usage, as such, Red Hat does not consider this a vulnerability.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-415: Double Free vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive settings necessary for operational requirements. Baseline configurations and system controls ensure secure software configurations, while least functionality reduces the attack surface by enforcing safe memory allocation and deallocation practices, lowering the risk of double-free vulnerabilities. The environment employs IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions to detect and prevent malicious code while providing real-time visibility into memory usage, reducing the risk of arbitrary code execution. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling, minimizing the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In the event of successful exploitation, process isolation prevents compromised workloads from accessing other processes’ memory, containing the potential impact. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) enhance resilience against memory-related vulnerabilities.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
