    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the webpack-dev-middleware package, where it failed to validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning local files. This flaw allows an attacker to craft URLs to return arbitrary local files from the developer's machine. The lack of normalization before calling the middleware also allows the attacker to perform path traversal attacks on the target environment. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability in webpack-dev represents a important security issue due to its potential to expose sensitive files and compromise developer machines. By failing to validate URLs and normalize paths effectively, the middleware allows attackers to craft malicious requests that can retrieve arbitrary local files or perform unauthorized path traversal. This could lead to unauthorized access to confidential information, including source code, configuration files, and even system-level files. Given the widespread use of webpack-dev-middleware in web development environments, addressing this vulnerability promptly is important to prevent serious data breaches and protect the integrity of development processes.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
