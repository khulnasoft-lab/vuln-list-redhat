    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in the Libreswan package. When an IKEv1 ISAKMP SA Informational Exchange packet contains a Delete/Notify payload followed by further Notifies that act on the ISAKMP SA, such as a duplicated Delete/Notify message, a NULL pointer dereference on the deleted state occurs. This flaw allows a malicious client or attacker to send a malformed IKEv1 Delete/Notify packet, causing a crash and restarting the libreswan pluto daemon. When sent continuously, this could lead to a denial of service attack. \n            STATEMENT: IKEv1 Delete/Notify requests are only processed when received from authenticated peers, limiting the scope of possible attackers to peers who have successfully authenticated.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform incorporates secure engineering principles and controls to enforce secure coding practices, including proper memory handling and error checking, reducing the likelihood of null pointer dereference vulnerabilities. Coding standards, tools, and processes support early detection and prevention of memory-related flaws. Static code analysis identifies null dereference and related issues during development, while system monitoring detects memory errors and anomalous behavior in the event of exploitation. Additionally, the platform leverages memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to strengthen resilience against memory-related vulnerabilities.",
