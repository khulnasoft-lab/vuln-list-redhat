    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A heap based buffer overflow was found in binutils-gdb/bfd/libbfd.c in bfd_getl64 in binutils. \n            STATEMENT: Because this vulnerability requires that an unsuspecting user uses binutils-gdb to analyze a specially crafted malicious DWARF file, and because the consequences of the memory corruption caused by the flaw are limited to the privileges of the user who analyzes the malicious file, Red Hat assesses this vulnerability's impact as Moderate.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer to CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability, and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nBoundary protection, access enforcement, and least privilege controls limit access to the platform and memory, ensuring only authorized users and processes can interact with sensitive components. This reduces the risk of attackers exploiting memory vulnerabilities. Configuration management controls like baseline configuration and least functionality can help prevent vulnerability exploitation by enforcing secure system configurations, enabling memory protection, and removing unnecessary services, ports, or functions that could be exploited. Memory protection controls mitigate the risk of potential memory corruption by enforcing runtime protections. Finally, process isolation and encryption of data at rest reduce the potential impacts in the case of successful exploitation by isolating compromised processes and ensuring sensitive data remains secure even in the event of memory corruption.",
