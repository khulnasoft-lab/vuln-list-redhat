    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in libtiff due to multiple potential integer overflows in raw2tiff.c. This flaw allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute an arbitrary code via a crafted tiff image, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nBaseline configurations and configuration controls enforce secure system and software settings, while least functionality reduces the attack surface by disabling unnecessary services and ports. In the event of successful exploitation, process isolation ensures that memory corruption is contained within the originating process, preventing it from affecting other processes or the system as a whole. The environment leverages malicious code protections such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions. These controls help detect and prevent malicious code that attempts to exploit integer overflow vulnerabilities through mechanisms like file integrity checks and patch management. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) are used to enhance resilience against integer overflows and denial-of-service attacks.",
