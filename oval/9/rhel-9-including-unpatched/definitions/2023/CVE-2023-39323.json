    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the golang cmd/go standard library. A line directive (\"//line\") can be used to bypass the restrictions on \"//go:cgo_\" directives, allowing blocked linker and compiler flags to pass during compilation. This can result in the unexpected execution of arbitrary code when running \"go build\". The line directive requires the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which makes exploiting this issue significantly more complex. \n            STATEMENT: This attack requires knowledge of the absolute path to the file containing the malicious directive, which significantly limits its feasibility for external attackers unless they already have local access or detailed knowledge of the system's layout. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must also convince a developer to download and build a malicious Go moduleâ€”an action typically constrained by trusted workflows and package verification.\n\nImportantly, this vulnerability does not impact running applications. Instead, it targets the development process, specifically developers or CI/CD pipelines during the build phase, further narrowing its scope.\n\nAs a result, this issue has been rated Moderate due to the multiple complex and unlikely prerequisites required for a successful exploit.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe implementation of AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) filters and blocks malicious input before it reaches the application. It uses predefined managed rules and custom rule sets to detect suspicious patterns, such as embedded scripting (eval(), exec(), system() calls) and remote code execution attempts. By enforcing strict input validation and preventing unauthorized execution of user-supplied code, AWS WAF reduces the risk of exploitation. Additionally, rate limiting and bot mitigation help prevent automated injection attacks, while integration with AWS Shield, CloudTrail, and Security Hub enhances threat detection and response. By providing real-time monitoring, logging, and automated blocking, AWS WAF adds a strong layer of defense against code injection vulnerabilities, reducing the chances of successful exploitation and unauthorized execution of malicious code.",
