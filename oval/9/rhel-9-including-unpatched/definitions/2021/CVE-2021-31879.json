    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in wget. If wget sends an Authorization header as part of a query and receives an HTTP REDIRECT to a third party in return, the Authorization header will be forwarded as part of the redirected request. This issue creates a password leak, as the second server receives the password. The highest threat from this vulnerability is confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successful exploitation of a CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is coupled with account management controls, including integration with single sign-on (SSO), to ensure that user permissions are restricted to only the functions necessary for their roles. Access to sensitive information is explicitly authorized and enforced based on predefined access policies. Event logs are collected and processed for centralization, correlation, analysis, monitoring, reporting, alerting, and retention. This process ensures that audit logs are generated for specific events involving sensitive information, which helps identify patterns of unauthorized access or data exposure. The platform enforces the use of validated cryptographic modules across compute resources to protect the confidentiality of information, even in the event of interception.\n            MITIGATION: Use `--max-redirect 0` when the request contains Authorization header to prevent wget to redirect the request.",
