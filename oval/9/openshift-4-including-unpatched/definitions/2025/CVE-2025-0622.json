    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in command/gpg. In some scenarios, hooks created by loaded modules are not removed when the related module is unloaded. This flaw allows an attacker to force grub2 to call the hooks once the module that registered it was unloaded, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. If correctly exploited, this vulnerability may result in arbitrary code execution, eventually allowing the attacker to bypass secure boot protections. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated the security impact for this flaw as Moderate due to the high privileges needed and the complexity involved to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-416: Use After Free vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) and is governed by least privilege to ensure that only authorized users and roles can execute or modify code. Red Hat also enforces least functionality, enabling only essential features, services, and ports. Hardening guidelines ensure the most restrictive settings required for operations, while baseline configurations enforce safe memory allocation and deallocation practices to reduce the risk of use-after-free vulnerabilities. The environment employs IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions to detect and prevent malicious code and provide real-time visibility into memory usage, lowering the risk of arbitrary code execution. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling, reducing the likelihood of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In the event of successful exploitation, process isolation prevents a compromised process from accessing memory freed by another, containing potential impact. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) enhance resilience against memory-related vulnerabilities.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
