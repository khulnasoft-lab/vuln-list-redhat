    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Avahi-daemon, where it initializes DNS transaction IDs randomly only once at startup, incrementing them sequentially after that. This predictable behavior facilitates DNS spoofing attacks, allowing attackers to guess transaction IDs. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-334: Small Space of Random Values vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) and is governed by least privilege, ensuring only authorized users can execute or modify code. External infrastructure and internal cluster certificates are maintained within a secure environment, and FIPS-validated cryptographic modules are enforced across all compute resources to prevent unauthorized access to intercepted data. The platform also uses trusted, validated name resolution paths to reduce the risk of interception or redirection that could expose or exploit weak random values.",
