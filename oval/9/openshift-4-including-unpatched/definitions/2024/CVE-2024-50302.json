    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's driver for Human Interface Devices. This flaw allows an attacker to use a malicious input device to read information from the report buffer. This could be used to leak kernel memory, enabling the exploitation of additional vulnerabilities. \n            STATEMENT: While this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of kernel memory, the impact is rated Moderate because exploitation  requires bypassing additional security features such as kernel address-space layout randomization (KASLR). It could be exploited by an authenticated, local attacker who emulates a malicious Human Interface Device (HID).\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive settings necessary for operations, while baseline configurations maintain secure system and software states. A defense-in-depth monitoring strategy includes perimeter firewalls and endpoint protection services that support automated detection of application crashes, data corruption, or inconsistent behavior caused by uninitialized resources. In the event of exploitation, process isolation ensures workloads operate in separate environments, preventing uninitialized variables or resources in one process from affecting others.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
