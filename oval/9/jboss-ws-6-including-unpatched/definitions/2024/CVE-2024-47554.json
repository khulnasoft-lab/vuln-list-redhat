    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the Apache Commons IO component in the org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader class. Excessive CPU resource consumption can lead to a denial of service when an untrusted input is processed. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nRed Hat restricts access to all platform information by default, granting access only after successful hard token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enforcing least privilege to ensure only authorized roles can execute or modify code. The environment employs malicious code protections, including IDS/IPS and antimalware tools to detect threats and monitor resource usage, helping prevent uncontrolled consumption that could lead to system failure. Additional safeguards, such as web application firewalls and load-balancing strategies, protect against resource exhaustion and performance degradation. Event logs are centrally collected, correlated, and analyzed to support monitoring, alerting, and retention, aiding in the detection of abnormal behavior and potential denial-of-service (DoS) conditions. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling, reducing the likelihood of input-based DoS attacks.",
