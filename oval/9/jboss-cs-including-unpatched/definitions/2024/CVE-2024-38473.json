    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the mod_proxy module of httpd. Due to an encoding problem, specially crafted request URLs with incorrect encoding can be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects configurations where mechanisms other than ProxyPass/ProxyPassMatch or RewriteRule with the 'P' flag are used to configure a request to be proxied, such as SetHandler or inadvertent proxying via CVE-2024-39573. Note that these alternate mechanisms may be used within .htaccess files.\n\nFor more information about CVE-2024-39573, see https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-39573.\n\nAdditionally, this flaw requires mod_proxy to be loaded and being used. This module can be disabled if its functionality is not needed.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of httpd.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
