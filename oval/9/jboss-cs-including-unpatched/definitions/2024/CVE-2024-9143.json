    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in OpenSSL. Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes. X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates. Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\" curve encoding.\n\nApplications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term via the affected APIs (EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),\nand various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions) may terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds. \n            STATEMENT: Openssl, compat-openssl10, and compat-openssl11 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9 are unaffected by this flaw, because the vulnerability is in code for binary field elliptic curves, which RHEL has never enabled.",
