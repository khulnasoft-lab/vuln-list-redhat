    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the mod_rewrite module of httpd. Due to a substitution encoding issue, specially crafted requests may allow an attacker to execute scripts in directories permitted by the configuration but not directly reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts meant only to be executed as CGI. \n            STATEMENT: This issue only affects configurations with unsafe rules used in the RewriteRule directive. Also, to exploit this flaw, an attacker must be able to upload files to the server.\n\nAdditionally, this flaw requires mod_rewrite to be loaded and used. This module can be disabled if its functionality is not needed.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of httpd.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
