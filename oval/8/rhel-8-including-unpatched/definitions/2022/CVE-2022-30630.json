    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the golang standard library, io/fs. Calling Glob on a path that contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic issue due to stack exhaustion. This could allow an attacker to impact availability. \n            STATEMENT: RH ProdSec has set the Impact of this vulnerability to Moderate as there is no known method to execute arbitary code. Successful exploitation of this bug can cause the application under attack to panic, merely causing a Denial of Service at the application level. As the kernel is unaffected by this bug, the user can merely relaunch the application to fix the problem. Also, if somehow the application keeps relaunching, the timer watchdogs in the default RHEL kernel will stop the attack in its tracks.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) and is governed by least privilege to ensure only authorized users and roles can execute or modify code. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, data exposure, or privilege escalation. In the event of successful exploitation, process isolation limits the impact of excessive sequential memory allocation by restricting memory use per process, preventing any single process from exhausting system resources. Finally, the platform uses memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to reduce the risk of memory allocation-based attacks.",
