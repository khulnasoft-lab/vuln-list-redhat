    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: Heap-based buffer overflow in archive_string_append_from_wcs() (archive_string.c) in libarchive-3.4.1dev allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write in heap memory resulting into a crash) via a crafted archive file. NOTE: this only affects users who downloaded the development code from GitHub. Users of the product's official releases are unaffected. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has set the Severity of this flaw to Low for libarchive as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because we could not reproduce the issue and it states \"NOTE: this only affects users who downloaded the development code from GitHub. Users of the product's official releases are unaffected.\"\n\nThis flaw is out of support scope for libarchive as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write to CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is coupled with least privilege principles to ensure that only authorized roles and users can execute or manipulate code. Red Hat enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. This minimizes the number of components that could be affected by heap-based buffer overflow exploitations. The environment leverages malicious code protections such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions that detect and respond to indicators in real time, preventing or limiting the impact of exploitation attempts. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) enhance resilience against memory buffer overflows and denial-of-service attacks.",
