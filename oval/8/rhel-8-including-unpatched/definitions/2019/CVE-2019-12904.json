    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: [Disputed] A vulnerability has been identified in Libgcrypt due to a flaw in its C implementation of AES. This vulnerability enables a remote attacker to perform a flush-and-reload side-channel attack, potentially accessing sensitive information. The vulnerability arises from the availability of physical addresses to other processes, particularly on platforms lacking an assembly-language implementation. \n            STATEMENT: Please note that this issue is more theoretical than practical in terms of potential attack scenarios. The upstream developers have disputed this CVE, and the patches they supplied seem to focus more on hardening. Refer to external references for further details.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-385: Covert Timing Channel vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive configurations necessary to meet operational requirements. Baseline settings and configuration controls ensure secure system and software configurations, while least functionality reduces the attack surface by limiting unnecessary system features and timing variations, thereby decreasing the risk of covert timing channels. Event logs are collected and processed for centralization, correlation, analysis, monitoring, alerting, and retention, supporting the detection of anomalous timing-based behavior that could indicate covert channel exploitation. Static code analysis and peer code reviews enforce robust input validation and error-handling practices, helping prevent unauthorized data transmission. Additionally, process isolation and encryption of data at rest limit the impact of successful exploitation by isolating compromised processes and preventing unauthorized data access or leakage across workloads.",
