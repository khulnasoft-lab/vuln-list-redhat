    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the net package of the Go stdlib. When a malformed DNS message is received as a response to a query, the Lookup functions within the net package can get stuck in an infinite loop. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS) conditions. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to ensure the most restrictive setting needed for operational requirements. Event logs are collected and processed for centralization, correlation, analysis, monitoring, reporting, alerting, and retention. This process ensures that audit logs are generated for specific events involving sensitive information, enabling capabilities like excessive CPU usage, long execution times, or processes consuming abnormal amounts of memory. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques are used to execute robust input validation and error-handling mechanisms to ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing infinite loops caused by malformed or unexpected input, such as unbounded user input or unexpected null values that cause loops to never terminate. In the event of successful exploitation, process isolation limits the effect of an infinite loop to a single process rather than allowing it to consume all system resources.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
