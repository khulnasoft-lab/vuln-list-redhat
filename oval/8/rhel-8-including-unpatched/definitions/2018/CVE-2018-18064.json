    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The CVE program describes this issue as: cairo through 1.15.14 has an out-of-bounds stack-memory write during processing of a crafted document by WebKitGTK+ because of the interaction between cairo-rectangular-scan-converter.c (the generate and render_rows functions) and cairo-image-compositor.c (the _cairo_image_spans_and_zero function). \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is coupled with least privilege principles to ensure that only authorized roles and users can execute or manipulate code. Red Hat enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. This minimizes the number of components that could be affected by stack-based buffer overflow exploitations. The environment leverages malicious code protections such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions that detect and respond to indicators in real time, preventing or limiting the impact of exploitation attempts. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques are used to ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) are used to enhance resilience against memory buffer overflows and denial-of-service attacks.\n            MITIGATION: Attackers can use specially-crafted files to trigger this stack-buffer overflow in cairo. Applications compiled with cairo, which do not parse untrusted 2D image files are not vulnerable to this flaw. cairo package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 is compiled with gcc's Stack Smashing Protection, which may reduce the impact of this flaw to crash only.",
