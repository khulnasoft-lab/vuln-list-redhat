    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the net/http package of the Golang standard library. The HTTP client drops sensitive headers after following a cross-domain redirect. For example, a request to `a.com/` containing an Authorization header redirected to `b.com/` will not send that header to `b.com`. However, the sensitive headers would be restored if the client received a subsequent same-domain redirect. For example, a chain of redirects from `a.com/`, to `b.com/1`, and finally to `b.com/2` would incorrectly send the Authorization header to `b.com/2`. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is coupled with account management controls, including integration with single sign-on (SSO), to ensure that user permissions are restricted to only the functions necessary for their roles. Access to sensitive information is explicitly authorized and enforced based on predefined access policies. Event logs are collected and processed for centralization, correlation, analysis, monitoring, reporting, alerting, and retention. This process ensures that audit logs are generated for specific events involving sensitive information, which helps identify patterns of unauthorized access or data exposure. The platform enforces the use of validated cryptographic modules across compute resources to protect the confidentiality of information, even in the event of interception.",
