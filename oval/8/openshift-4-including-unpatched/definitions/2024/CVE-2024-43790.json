    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the VIM package. When performing a search and displaying the search count message is disabled, the search pattern is shown at the bottom of the screen, and this text is stored in an internal buffer. The search pattern is reversed when using the right-left search mode, and a new internal buffer will be created. If the original search pattern contains NULL characters, the newly allocated buffer will be smaller than the required size, leading to a head-based out-of-bounds read. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into running the malicious search pattern and execute all the steps required to cause the out-of-bounds read. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact because the \"victim\" has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random Python script and running it.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is coupled with least privilege principles to ensure that only authorized roles and users can execute or manipulate code. Red Hat enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. This minimizes the number of components that could be affected by heap-based buffer overflow exploitations. The environment leverages malicious code protections such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions that detect and respond to indicators in real time, preventing or limiting the impact of exploitation attempts. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks. Finally, memory protection mechanisms such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) enhance resilience against memory buffer overflows and denial-of-service attacks.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
