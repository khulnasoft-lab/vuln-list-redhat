    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Golang Go, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by an issue during multipart form parsing. By sending a specially crafted input, a remote attacker can consume large amounts of CPU and memory, resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: For Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\n\n* Conmon uses Go in unit testing, but not functionally in the package. Go is used only in test files, hence, not in the actual code, thus, conmon is not-affected.\n* The CVE refers to multipart form parsing routine mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, which is not used in Grafana, hence it is not-affected.\n* Butane does not parse multipart forms, hence, it is also not-affected.\nRedhat has marked this vulnerability as moderate as this vulnerability could lead to a potential denial of service when all the resource of a system is consumed which is technically not a clear case of denial of service.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nRed Hat restricts access to all platform information by default, granting access only after successful hard token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enforcing least privilege to ensure only authorized roles can execute or modify code. The environment employs malicious code protections, including IDS/IPS and antimalware tools to detect threats and monitor resource usage, helping prevent uncontrolled consumption that could lead to system failure. Additional safeguards, such as web application firewalls and load-balancing strategies, protect against resource exhaustion and performance degradation. Event logs are centrally collected, correlated, and analyzed to support monitoring, alerting, and retention, aiding in the detection of abnormal behavior and potential denial-of-service (DoS) conditions. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling, reducing the likelihood of input-based DoS attacks.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
