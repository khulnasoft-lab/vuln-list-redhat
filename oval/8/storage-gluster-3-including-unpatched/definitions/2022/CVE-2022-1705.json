    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in golang. The HTTP/1 client accepted invalid Transfer-Encoding headers indicating \"chunked\" encoding. This issue could allow request smuggling, but only if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly accepts the header as invalid. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform uses secure, encrypted HTTPS connections over TLS 1.2 to reduce the risk of smuggling attacks by preventing the injection of ambiguous or malformed requests between components. The environment employs IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions to detect and block malicious code while ensuring consistent interpretation of HTTP requests across network layers, mitigating request/response inconsistencies. Event logs are collected and analyzed for centralization, correlation, monitoring, alerting, and retention, enabling the detection of malformed or suspicious HTTP traffic. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling to ensure all user inputs adhere to HTTP protocol specifications.",
