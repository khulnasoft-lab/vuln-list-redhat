    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An incorrect control flow implementation vulnerability was found in Requests. If the first request in a session is made with verify=False, all subsequent requests to the same host will continue to ignore cert verification. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-670: Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform's orchestration features, such as liveness and readiness probes, automated pod restarts, and health monitoring, help to quickly detect and recover from service-level failures resulting from incorrect control flows. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques are used to execute robust input validation and error-handling mechanisms to ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks. Additionally, process isolation ensures that component issues are contained within the originating process, preventing them from affecting other processes or the system as a whole.",
