    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Go language standard library net/netip. The method Is*() (IsPrivate(), IsPublic(), etc) doesn't behave properly when working with IPv6 mapped to IPv4 addresses. The unexpected behavior can lead to integrity and confidentiality issues, specifically when these methods are used to control access to resources or data. \n            STATEMENT: This CVE has been marked as moderate as for our products a network-based attack vector is simply impossible when it comes to golang code,apart from that as per CVE flaw analysis reported by golang, this only affects integrity and confidentiality and has no effect on availability, hence CVSS has been marked as such.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nControls such as input validation and error handling mitigate input misinterpretation risks by enforcing strict validation rules and secure error management. Error handling ensures inputs are validated against predefined formats, preventing malformed data from being misinterpreted. Techniques like strong typing, allow listing, and proper encoding reduce the likelihood of injection attacks and unintended code execution. Input validation also ensures that errors do not expose sensitive system details or cause unpredictable behavior. Secure error handling prevents information leakage through detailed error messages while preserving system stability under malformed input conditions. Together, these controls reduce the attack surface by maintaining consistent input processing and preventing exploitable system states, strengthening the overall security posture.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
