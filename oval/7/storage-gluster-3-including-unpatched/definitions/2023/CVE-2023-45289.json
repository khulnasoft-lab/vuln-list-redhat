    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Go's net/http/cookiejar standard library package. When following an HTTP redirect to a domain that is not a subdomain match or an exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward sensitive headers such as \"Authorization\" or \"Cookie\". For example, a redirect from foo.com to www.foo.com will forward the Authorization header, but a redirect to bar.com will not. A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause sensitive headers to be unexpectedly forwarded. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful hard token, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is coupled with account management controls, including integration with single sign-on (SSO), to ensure that user permissions are restricted to only the functions necessary for their roles. Access to sensitive information is explicitly authorized and enforced based on predefined access policies. Event logs are collected and processed for centralization, correlation, analysis, monitoring, reporting, alerting, and retention. This process ensures that audit logs are generated for specific events involving sensitive information, which helps identify patterns of unauthorized access or data exposure. The platform enforces the use of validated cryptographic modules across compute resources to protect the confidentiality of information, even in the event of interception.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
