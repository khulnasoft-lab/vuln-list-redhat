    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Django framework. Lack of upper bound limit enforcement in strings passed when performing IPv6 validation could lead to a potential denial of service attack. The undocumented and private functions `clean_ipv6_address` and `is_valid_ipv6_address` were vulnerable, as was the `django.forms.GenericIPAddressField` form field, which has now been updated to define a `max_length` of 39 characters. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive settings required for operations, while baseline configurations maintain secure system and software states. A defense-in-depth monitoring strategy includes perimeter firewalls and endpoint protection services that detect excessive resource usage caused by malicious activity or system misconfigurations. In the event of exploitation, process isolation ensures workloads operate in separate environments, preventing any single process from overconsuming CPU or memory and degrading system performance.",
