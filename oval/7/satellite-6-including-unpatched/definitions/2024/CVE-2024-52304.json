    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the aiohttp package. The Python parser parses newlines in chunk extensions incorrectly, which can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed, for example, without the usual C extensions, or `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS` is enabled, an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform uses secure, encrypted HTTPS connections over TLS 1.2 to reduce the risk of smuggling attacks by preventing the injection of ambiguous or malformed requests between components. The environment employs IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions to detect and block malicious code while ensuring consistent interpretation of HTTP requests across network layers, mitigating request/response inconsistencies. Event logs are collected and analyzed for centralization, correlation, monitoring, alerting, and retention, enabling the detection of malformed or suspicious HTTP traffic. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling to ensure all user inputs adhere to HTTP protocol specifications.",
