    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in libarchive. This issue can cause a race condition in a multi-threaded use of archive_write_disk_header() on posix based systems, which could allow implicit directory creation with permissions 777, without sticky bit, which means any low privileged user on the system can delete and rename files inside those directories. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nRed Hat enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. The environment leverages malicious code protections such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions that detect and respond to indicators in real time, enabling ROSA to prevent or limit the impact of exploitation attempts. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques are used to execute robust input validation and error-handling mechanisms to ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks. In the case of successful exploitation, detection and containment controls are in place to limit impacts by alerting on anomalous system behavior in real time, while process isolation and automated orchestration via Kubernetes minimize the likelihood of concurrent execution scenarios that would trigger the race condition and help contain the impact to a single process.",
