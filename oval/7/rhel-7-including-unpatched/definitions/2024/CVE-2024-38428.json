    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in wget. Incorrect handling of semicolons in the userinfo subcomponent of a URI allows it to be misinterpreted as part of the host subcomponent, potentially exposing user credentials. \n            STATEMENT: Only calls to Wget using semicolons in the userinfo subcomponent of a URI are vulnerable to this issue. However, this is allowed by the standard and is supported by other similar tools.\nTo exploit this issue, an attacker must convince a local user into running Wget with a specially crafted userinfo subcomponent, limiting the exposure of this vulnerability.\nFor these reasons, this vulnerability has been rated with a moderate severity.\n\nAdditionally, this vulnerability only affects wget 1.x, wget2 is not affected.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nControls such as input validation and error handling mitigate input misinterpretation risks by enforcing strict validation rules and secure error management. Error handling ensures inputs are validated against predefined formats, preventing malformed data from being misinterpreted. Techniques like strong typing, allow listing, and proper encoding reduce the likelihood of injection attacks and unintended code execution. Input validation also ensures that errors do not expose sensitive system details or cause unpredictable behavior. Secure error handling prevents information leakage through detailed error messages while preserving system stability under malformed input conditions. Together, these controls reduce the attack surface by maintaining consistent input processing and preventing exploitable system states, strengthening the overall security posture.\n            MITIGATION: Make sure to not add semicolons in the userinfo subcomponent of a URI.",
