    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Keycloak. When an Active Directory user resets their password, the system updates it without performing an LDAP bind to validate the new credentials against AD. This vulnerability allows users whose AD accounts are expired or disabled to regain access in Keycloak, bypassing AD restrictions. The issue enables authentication bypass and could allow unauthorized access under certain conditions. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-287: Improper Authentication vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful authentication through multifactor authentication (MFA). Domain accounts are configured to lock out based on predefined access policies, reducing the effectiveness of brute-force attacks on authentication mechanisms. The platform employs IAM roles for identification and authentication within its cloud infrastructure that govern user access to resources and manage provisioning, deployment, and configuration within the platform environment. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access through third-party or external user accounts. Finally, memory protection mechanisms are used to enhance resilience against unauthorized commands or improper authentication.",
