    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in golang. Extraneous zero characters at the beginning of an IP address octet are not properly considered which could allow an attacker to bypass IP-based access controls. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability potentially affects any component written in Go that uses the net standard library and ParseIP / ParseCIDR functions. There are components which might not use these functions or might use them to parse IP addresses and not manage them in any way (only store information about the ip address) . This reduces the severity of this vulnerability to Low for the following offerings:\n* OpenShift distributed tracing (formerly OpenShift Jaeger)\n* OpenShift Migration Toolkit for Containers\n* OpenShift Container Platform\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nRed Hat enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. This minimizes the number of components that could be affected by input validation vulnerabilities. Security testing and evaluation standards are implemented within the environment to rigorously test input validation mechanisms during the development lifecycle, while static code analysis identifies potential input validation vulnerabilities by default. Process isolation ensures that processes handling potentially malicious or unvalidated inputs run in isolated environments by separating execution domains for each process. Malicious code protections, such as IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions, help detect and mitigate malicious payloads stemming from input validation vulnerabilities. Finally, robust input validation and error-handling mechanisms ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing improperly validated inputs from causing system instability, exposing sensitive data, or escalating risks further.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
