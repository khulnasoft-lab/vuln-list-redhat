    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the GNU C Library (glibc). A buffer overflow condition via the `assert()` function may be triggered due to glibc not allocating enough space for the assertion failure message string and size information. In certain conditions, a local attacker can exploit this, potentially leading to an application crash or other undefined behavior. \n            STATEMENT: The bug is with glib assert() function that is typically used to identify logic errors in programs. The specific vulnerability stems in not enough being allocated to fit an arbitrary length error statement that is passed to the assert() function. The lack of any check on the string length causes the buffer overflow.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nSecure baseline configurations establish a hardened environment, while rigorous testing practices (e.g., SAST, DAST) identify and address memory vulnerabilities before code reaches production. Malicious code protections further reduce risk by detecting, blocking, and responding to exploitation attempts. The platform runs on OS versions that inherit security features from RHEL, such as SELinux and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Least functionality and process isolation reduce the attack surface by disabling unauthorized services and containing any corruption within the originating process, preventing broader system impact.",
