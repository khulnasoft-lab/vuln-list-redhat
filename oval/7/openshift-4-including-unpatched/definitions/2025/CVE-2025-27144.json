    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in GO-JOSE. In affected versions, when parsing compact JWS or JWE input, Go JOSE could use excessive memory. The code uses strings.Split(token, \".\") to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of `.` characters. This issue could be exploied by sending numerous malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive settings required for operations, while baseline configurations maintain secure system and software states. A defense-in-depth monitoring strategy includes perimeter firewalls and endpoint protection services that detect excessive resource usage caused by malicious activity or system misconfigurations. In the event of exploitation, process isolation ensures workloads operate in separate environments, preventing any single process from overconsuming CPU or memory and degrading system performance.\n            MITIGATION: As a workaround, applications can pre-validate that payloads being passed to Go JOSE do not contain an excessive number of `.` characters.",
