    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in golang. An attacker can craft an input to ParseFragment within parse.go that would cause it to enter an infinite loop and never return. The greatest threat to the system is of availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Developer Tools go-toolset-1.14-golang not affected because the vulnerable code is not shipped.\n\nThis vulnerability within golang and buildah shipped with RHEL-7 are out of support scope. For more information on Red Hat's support scope, visit: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata\n\nFor RHEL-8's go-toolset:rhel8/golang, container-tools:1.0/buildah, container-tools:2.0/buildah, and container-tools:rhel8/buildah, the affected function is only used in e2e tests.\n\nFor RHEL-9's golang and buildah, the affected function is only used in e2e tests.\n\nRed Hat Openshift Container Storage has dependencies with the affected code, however, low priority trackers were filed as the vulnerable code is not shipped or used.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to ensure the most restrictive setting needed for operational requirements. Event logs are collected and processed for centralization, correlation, analysis, monitoring, reporting, alerting, and retention. This process ensures that audit logs are generated for specific events involving sensitive information, enabling capabilities like excessive CPU usage, long execution times, or processes consuming abnormal amounts of memory. Static code analysis and peer code review techniques are used to execute robust input validation and error-handling mechanisms to ensure all user inputs are thoroughly validated, preventing infinite loops caused by malformed or unexpected input, such as unbounded user input or unexpected null values that cause loops to never terminate. In the event of successful exploitation, process isolation limits the effect of an infinite loop to a single process rather than allowing it to consume all system resources.",
