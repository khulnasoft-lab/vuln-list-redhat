    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A memory exhaustion flaw was found in the otelgrpc handler of open-telemetry. This flaw may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to flood the peer address and port and exhaust the server's memory by sending multiple malicious requests, affecting the availability of the system. \n            STATEMENT: While no authentication is required, there are a significant number of non-default factors that prevent widespread exploitation of this issue. To affect a service, all of the following must be true:\n- The go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc package must be in use\n- Configured a metrics pipeline that uses the UnaryServerInterceptor wrapper function\n- No filtering of unknown HTTP methods or user agents at a higher level, such as Content Delivery Network\n\nDue to the limited attack surface, Red Hat Product Security rates the impact of this flaw as Moderate.\n\ncluster-network-operator-container in Openshift Container Platform 4 is rated as low and Won't Fix as the stats are behind an RBAC proxy and isn't available to unauthenticated users.\n\nWithin regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nThe platform enforces hardening guidelines to apply the most restrictive settings required for operations, while baseline configurations maintain secure system and software states. A defense-in-depth monitoring strategy includes perimeter firewalls and endpoint protection services that detect excessive resource usage caused by malicious activity or system misconfigurations. In the event of exploitation, process isolation ensures workloads operate in separate environments, preventing any single process from overconsuming CPU or memory and degrading system performance.\n            MITIGATION: As a workaround, use a view removing the attributes. Another possibility is to disable grpc metrics instrumentation by passing otelgrpc.WithMeterProvider option with noop.NewMeterProvider.",
