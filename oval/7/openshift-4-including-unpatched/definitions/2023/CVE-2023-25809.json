    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in runc, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by improper access control in the /sys/fs/cgroup endpoint. This flaw allows a local authenticated attacker to cause a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess enforcement ensures that only authorized users can access system resources, reducing the risk of exploited default permissions. Remote access controls further limit exposure by blocking unauthorized external access, preventing attackers from leveraging misconfigured permissions. Baseline and configuration setting controls enforce secure defaults, reducing the likelihood of weak permissions at deployment. Access restrictions for change ensure only authorized personnel can modify system configurations, preventing accidental or malicious security weaknesses. Together, these controls mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and exploitation of insecure default permissions.\n            MITIGATION: Condition 1: Unshare the cgroup namespace ((docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private). This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts.\nCondition 2 (very rare): add /sys/fs/cgroup to maskedPaths",
