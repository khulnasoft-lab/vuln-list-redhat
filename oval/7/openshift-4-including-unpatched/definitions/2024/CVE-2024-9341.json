    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Go. When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container runtimes may incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper validation in the containers/common Go library. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit symbolic links and trick the system into mounting sensitive host directories inside a container. This issue also allows attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation between containers and the host system. \n            STATEMENT: Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.\n\nAccess to the platform is granted only after successful authentication through multifactor authentication (MFA). MFA combined with least privilege and RBAC restricts access to only authorized users, processes, and roles, minimizing the number of users who would be able to access or modify sensitive and non-sensitive files. Red Hat also enforces the principle of least functionality, ensuring that only essential features, services, and ports are enabled. This minimizes the number of components that could be affected through system compartmentalization. FIPS endpoints are enabled for all AWS GovCloud services that are used within the platform environment, ensuring that sensitive data stored on the system is encrypted or otherwise protected. Together, these controls help to prevent unauthorized access to files or the ability to manipulate the links to files.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
